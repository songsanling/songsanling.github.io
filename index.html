      <div>
          My areas of research are reliability modeling of systems with multiple dependent and competing risks, and maintenance policies and optimization.  
          My research has been supported by NSF project, and Qatar national research fund, and Chinese national basic research program. 
          One significant contribution of my research is to develop reliability models for complex systems subject to dependent competing failure 
          processes with degradation process and random shock by considering different dependent scenarios: dependent failure processes within and 
          among components, dependent failure times among components, dependent component  degradation propagations, etc. 
          Also, different maintenance policies are studied: preventive maintenance, corrective maintenance, condition based maintenance, etc. 
          Multi-objective optimization is conducted for the trade-off among objectives like maintenance cost, system availability, etc. 
          More adequate models lead to better system reliability estimation, and decision optimization. 
          I focus on the application of many evolving technologies, such as manufacturing (MEMS), 
          health care (biomedical implant devices), energy systems (liquefied natural gas system) and other systems.
